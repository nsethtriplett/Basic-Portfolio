                I was born in Columbia, Missouri on July 30th, 1996.
                This is not where or when I chose to be born, but we don't always
                get to choose our circumstances. I grew up in a loving home with three other siblings--
                two brothers and one sister (she also happens to be my favorite sister). Their 
                names are Noah (25), Hannah (18), and Levi (14). 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2005 we moved to Joplin, Missouri, and I've lived there for roughly 12 years. 
                I attended high school and was then shipped off
                to college, eventually transferring to two other colleges until I realized 
                that learning code could be a fresh start. I wanted financial freedom, physcial freedom to go where I 
                please, and an opportunity to see what could happen if I chose a path that differed from what had
                been planned for me for most of my life.
